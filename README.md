![JBoss Admin][0]

The app will allow you to remotely administer a JBoss 7, WildFly or JBoss EAP using the server's exposed http management interface.

Features
--------

The application supports the following features:

* __Subsystem Metrics Monitoring__

    The metrics currently exposed are for Configuration, JVM, Data Sources, JMS Destinations, Transactions and Web subsystems (similar to those shown in the JBoss built-in web console).

* __Deployments Management__

    You can upload an artifact (installed on your iPhone through iTunes file sharing mechanism) and then enable/disable it on the server.

* __Browse the management tree__

    The whole management tree is exposed for you to configure, similar to the JBoss-cli {-gui} tool provided by the server. You can easily modify attributes and execute operations. Documentation of attributes and operation parameters is easily accessed for you to refer.

Note that both operating modes (Standalone/Domain) of the server are supported. If running in "Domain" mode, you can easily switch the server you want to monitor its metrics, as well as manage deployments on each individual server-group.
